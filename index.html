    <p>
        I am a PhD candidate (ABD) in Political Science at the University of California, Davis, with a research focus on American politics and methodology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In American politics, my work explores how local political institutions shape public policy and financial decisions, delving into the ways these institutions shift power dynamics among key stakeholders, including average citizens and elected officials.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the methodological front, I specialize in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured data. My research includes developing innovative techniques, such as automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and consensus mechanisms, to create tools that automate the labeling and generation of text-based variables for social science research.
