            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing text classification efficiency in political science, surpassing traditional machine learning methods that often require extensive feature engineering, human labeling, and task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in achieving high classification accuracy remains questionable. This paper introduces a three-stage in-context learning approach that leverages LLMs to improve classification accuracy while minimizing experimental costs. Our method incorporates automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism that resolves discrepancies between two weaker LLMs, refined by an advanced LLM. We validate our approach using datasets from the BBC news reports, Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation, and 2018 election campaign ads. The results show significant improvements in classification F1 score (+0.36 for zero-shot classification) with manageable economic costs (-78% compared with human labeling), demonstrating that our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning while offering a scalable and reliable solution for text analysis in political science. A free software Python package will be publicly available on GitHub very soon.

            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Local opposition to high-density residential construction is a major contributor to the housing crisis in the United States. The lack of affordable housing has wide-reaching implications for local economic performance, social challenges like homelessness and food insecurity, and income inequality. Amid this housing struggle, this study delves into the role of direct democracy in affecting local land use policies in nearly 1,000 U.S. cities between 2006 and 2018. Although direct democracy is arising as a common solution for local land use disputes, its actual implications on housing policies remained unexplored. This study, using matching and difference-in-differences design, provides robust evidence that cities adopting direct democracy are more inclined to impose stringent land use policies, often favoring established anti-growth interests in the city. This study further reveals that, in high-income cities, the effect of direct democracy remains constant, irrespective of the homeowner and renter power dynamics. However, in lower-income cities, the effect of direct democracy becomes more pronounced, underlining significant changes based on the power balance of homeowners and renters. These findings shed light on how political institutions could affect public policies, and how varying socioeconomic contexts could shape democratic processes in city development.
