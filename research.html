            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing text classification efficiency in political science, surpassing traditional machine learning methods that often require extensive feature engineering, human labeling, and task-specific training. This paper introduces a three-stage in-context learning approach that leverages LLMs to improve classification accuracy while minimizing experimental costs. Our method incorporates automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism that resolves discrepancies between two weaker LLMs, refined by an advanced LLM. We validate our approach using datasets from the BBC news reports, Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation, and 2018 election campaign ads. The results show significant improvements in classification F1 score (+0.36 for zero-shot classification) with manageable economic costs (-78% compared with human labeling), demonstrating that our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning while offering a scalable and reliable solution for text analysis in political science.

            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Local opposition to high-density residential construction is a major contributor to the housing crisis in the United States. The lack of affordable housing has wide-reaching implications for local economic performance, social challenges like homelessness and food insecurity, and income inequality. Amid this housing struggle, this study delves into the role of direct democracy in affecting local land use policies in nearly 1,000 U.S. cities between 2006 and 2018. Although direct democracy is arising as a common solution for local land use disputes, its actual implications on housing policies remained unexplored. This study, using matching and difference-in-differences design, provides robust evidence that cities adopting direct democracy are more inclined to impose stringent land use policies, often favoring established anti-growth interests in the city. This study further reveals that, in high-income cities, the effect of direct democracy remains constant, irrespective of the homeowner and renter power dynamics. However, in lower-income cities, the effect of direct democracy becomes more pronounced, underlining significant changes based on the power balance of homeowners and renters. These findings shed light on how political institutions could affect public policies, and how varying socioeconomic contexts could shape democratic processes in city development.

            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Housing consistently ranks as one of the most significant assets for ordinary citizens in China. Despite its crucial importance, political economists have scarcely explored its impact on citizensâ€™ welfare and their demands from the government. This study addresses the critical role of housing, focusing on its heterogeneous impact on social policy preferences among homeowners. Specifically, employing both matching techniques and instrumental variable analysis, our findings indicate that homeownership leads to increased support for policies related to redistribution. We also find that homeownership increases support for redistribution across the board but does so more substantially among employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) compared to their private-sector counterparts. Through the application of mediation analysis, this research uncovers how different channels potentially mediate the effect of homeownership on social redistribution attitudes. The findings shed light on the nuanced, heterogeneous effects of housing as an economic asset on the socio-political dynamics of policy support in China, underscoring the importance of contextual factors in understanding the socio-economic implications of homeownership.
